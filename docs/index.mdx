In this guide we're going to learn how to go from zero to a running Cshell instance with the least amount of effort.

<Steps>
1. ### Installation

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="mac">
        You can use Homebrew to install the latest version of Cshell in Mac (both x86 / ARM64)

        ```sh
        brew install txpipe/tap/cshell
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="linux">
        You can install Cshell on linux system using the following command:

        ```sh
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/txpipe/cshell/releases/latest/download/cshell-installer.sh | sh
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="windows">
        You can use PowerShell to install Cshell on your system:

        ```sh
        powershell -c "irm https://github.com/txpipe/cshell/releases/latest/download/cshell-installer.ps1 | iex"
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="npm">
        You can use Npm to install Cshell on your system:

        ```sh
        npm install @txpipe/cshell
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. ### Configuration

    _Cshell_ requires a UtxoRPC and TRP provider, the UtxoRPC is to fetch on-chain data, and the TRP is to resolve and submit transactions. You can get one free instance on [demeter](https://demeter.run/). So when you have the UtxoRPC and TRP url, run the following command that will guide you through a set of questions to define a provider:

    ```sh
    cshell provider create
    ```
    
    With the provider configured, it is possible to create a wallet or import one. The following example shows how to create one.

    ```sh
    cshell wallet create
    ```

3. ### Running

    Explore the commands in the docs or run `cshell --help`. The following command opens a GUI explorer using the default provider.

    ```sh
    cshell explorer
    ```

</Steps>
