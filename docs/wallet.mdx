How cshell handles wallet creation, storage, and security. Understanding these concepts is crucial for managing your funds safely.

### Wallet storage
All cshell wallet configurations are stored in a single file on your local machine:

- File: **cshell.toml**  
- Location: In your user home directory (examples: **~/cshell.toml**)

This file contains the definitions for every wallet you create, import, or restore.

### Security and encryption
Cshell protects private keys using a password-based encryption model.

- When you create a wallet you set a spending password.
- The password is run through Argon2 to derive an encryption key, and that key is used with the `ChaCha20-Poly1305` cipher to encrypt the walletâ€™s private key.  
- **Your password is never stored on disk**, it exists only in memory when needed to sign a transaction.

<Aside type="caution">
Because the password is never stored, it cannot be recovered. If you lose it you must restore the wallet from its mnemonic seed phrase
</Aside>

### Unsafe wallets (plain-text keys)
Cshell supports an `--unsafe` option at creation time (wallet create --unsafe).

- What it does: disables password protection and stores the private key in plain text inside cshell.toml.  
- Intended use: temporary, disposable wallets for development or testing only.

<Aside type="caution">
Never store real funds in an unsafe wallet. Anyone with access to cshell.toml can control those funds
</Aside>

### Importing vs restoring wallets
Cshell supports both wallet import and wallet restore, these are different operations with different functional implications.

- Import: creating read-only (watch-only) wallets.
- Restore: recovering fully functional wallets using the mnemonic seed phrase.

## Usage
Create a wallet using the **interactive** command below:

```bash
cshell wallet create 
```

You can manage wallets using Cshell's wallet commands. To see which wallet commands are available, run the following:

```bash
cshell wallet --help
```

And the `--help` flag can be used anywhere in Cshell. For example, after choosing the create command, you can check the options available for that command as well:

```bash
cshell wallet create --help
```
