In the CShell [repo](https://github.com/txpipe/cshell) you can find scripts demonstrating advanced capabilities.

## Batch transactions

This example shows how to send transactions to multiple recipients in a batch.

**Location:** [`examples/batch-transactions/`](https://github.com/txpipe/cshell/tree/main/examples/batch-transactions)

**Usage:**
```sh
./transfer.sh <sender_wallet> <receiver_wallets_list> <lovelace_amount>
```

**Arguments:**
- `sender_wallet`: Name of the wallet sending the funds (e.g., `alice`)
- `receiver_wallets_list`: Comma-separated list of recipient wallet names (e.g., `bob,charlie,mark`)
- `lovelace_amount`: Amount in lovelaces to send to each recipient (e.g., `1000000`)

**Example:**
```sh
./transfer.sh alice bob,charlie,mark 1000000
```

This will send 1,000,000 lovelaces from Alice's wallet to Bob, Charlie, and Mark individually.

## Scheduled tasks

This example demonstrates how to schedule recurring transactions using cron expressions.

**Location:** [`examples/scheduled-tasks/`](https://github.com/txpipe/cshell/tree/main/examples/scheduled-tasks)

**Usage:**
```sh
./transfer.sh <sender_wallet> <receiver_wallet> <lovelace_amount> <cron_string>
```

**Arguments:**
- `sender_wallet`: Name of the wallet sending the funds (e.g., `alice`)
- `receiver_wallet`: Name of the recipient wallet (e.g., `bob`)
- `lovelace_amount`: Amount in lovelaces to send (e.g., `1000000`)
- `cron_string`: Cron schedule expression in the format `'minute hour day month weekday'`

**Example:**
```sh
./transfer.sh alice bob 1000000 '0 */2 * * *'
```

This will schedule a transfer of 1,000,000 lovelaces from Alice to Bob every 2 hours.

## Complex transaction

This example shows how to interact with a protocol that requires several parameters, specifically creating a ship in [Asteria](https://asteria.txpipe.io).

**Location:** [`examples/complex-transaction/`](https://github.com/txpipe/cshell/tree/main/examples/complex-transaction)

**Usage:**
```sh
./create-ship.sh <player_wallet> <pos_x> <pos_y>
```

**Arguments:**
- `player_wallet`: Name of the player's wallet (e.g., `alice`)
- `pos_x`: X coordinate for the ship position (integer)
- `pos_y`: Y coordinate for the ship position (integer)

**Example:**
```sh
./create-ship.sh alice 25 25
```

This will create a new ship for Alice at coordinates (25, 25) in [Asteria](https://asteria.txpipe.io).
